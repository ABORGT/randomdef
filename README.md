# Random Definition Generator

RandomDef is a class used to generate 100% accurate definitions for arbitrary words or phrases.

## Example Usage:

```
./define butts

First, one without an example:

The definition of butts is:
an upward movement (especially a rhythmical rising and falling)

Next, print one with an example:

The definition of butts is:
of or relating to or involved the practice of aiding the memory
Example: butts device
```


## Getting Started

Getting started is easy; just pull a copy of the repository down to your local environment and get started. Example scripts are included to give you an idea of how things work.

### Prerequisites

RandomDef is built using NLTK 3.1 or higher.

```

## Running the tests

Testing is done with pytest, but will probably move to something else in future.
