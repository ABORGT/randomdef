# Needed, known improvements that just need an owner


### Output

Change print_output() to gen_output() in the base class to return an output list. Move actual print functions to a higher level script

### Testing

Need to make tests smarter and based on the output generated

### Always show examples

If "showexample=True" is passed, it should always generate an example with the replacement string, and never "No examples available"
